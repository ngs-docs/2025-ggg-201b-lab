# Two introductions to UNIX - GGG classes, WQ 2025

The following two resources are my recommendations for people who are
relatively new to UNIX, or want a refresher. They are shorter and more
focused than my workshop,
[Introduction to Remote Computing](https://ngs-docs.github.io/2021-august-remote-computing/)
(which I also recommend, and which comes with videos - the UNIX-y bits
are the first two lectures).

Please let me know at ctbrown@ucdavis.edu if you run into any problems.

## Happy Belly Bioinformatics - UNIX Crash Course

Author: Mike Lee, International Man of Mystery

UNIX crash course: [link](https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/unix-intro)

To get started with these, start up RStudio via
https://ondemand.farm.hpc.ucdavis.edu/ (you can usually use the
default settings - but high2, 2 cores, and 5 GB of RAM should be
enough!)

Once RStudio is running, select the Terminal tab in the Console area,
and you'll be at a shell prompt where you can run the tutorial
commands.

At this point, go to
[Getting Started: A Few Foundational Rules](https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/getting-started#a-few-foundational-rules)
and start there!

I suggest going through at least the first two tutorials & completing
"Working with files and directories", although you should skim
"Redirectors and wildcards" if you can.

## Hannah's UNIX Cafe (+ some R)

Author: Hannah Houts, UC Davis, MGG Grad Group

This is an introductory tutorial for RStudio, RMarkdown, UNIX shell, and R.

Go [here](https://github.com/ctb/hannahs-unix-cafe) and follow the directions!
