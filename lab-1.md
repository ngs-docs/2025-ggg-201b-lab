# GGG 201b WQ 2025 - Lab 1, Links and info - Jan 10, 2025

### First task

Connect to https://ondemand.farm.hpc.ucdavis.edu/ and log in.

Select RStudio.

Adjust the following entries:
* Account: ctbrowngrp
* Partition: bmh
* Number of cores: 2
* Amount of memory: 5
* conda environment: blank
* R version: latest
* Number of hours: 2

Then select "Launch".

Flag me down if you run into any problems during any of this :).

## Second task: answer some survey questions!

While we're working through any problems with the above, please fill out these forms! They're anonymous, FYI.

[What's your research interest?](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7j6mvXvqaJe5oq0pPeOddLqrkvVPXCngAJJdYwztQeqH_Sg/viewform?usp=dialog)

[Level of comfort with various topics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUM9T-x5YKoAUp3qEE39akb47dE-N4P9F6LaPdJfj3vZMRhg/viewform?usp=dialog)

### Introductions!

- Titus Brown. My research & my teaching.
    - sequence analysis generally, research focus on microbiome and shotgun metagenomics
    - serve as one of several support profs for lots of bioinformatics on campus
    - larger emphasis on training, open source/open science, and reproducibility
- DataLab Faculty Director for Community Engagement
    - what does DataLab do? support your data science journey!
    - see also [DataLab Workshops](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/workshops/#upcoming) - they're free!

### Bioinformatics, genomics, data science, and computing

What are they?

Three sets of threes:
- the three circles of data science (=> bioinformatics): science domain, math/statistics, practical knowledge of how to do something.
- the three types of bioinformaticians: biomedical data scientist, methods developer, and workflow-enabled bioinformatician.
- the three practical skillsets you need: scripting, interpreting, organizing

What do you need to know?

How do you learn it?

How will you know you've learned it?

My perspective/suggestion: view this through the lens of **community of practice**. It's just like knitting or dancing: you've got to actively do it in order to learn it.

If you are doing computing, embed yourself in a community of practice - your lab, your grad group, the Genome Center, DataLab, or online.

Above all, do not think that you can just take a class NOW in preparation for doing data analysis in 6 or 12 or 18 months. This will introduce you to the concepts and some of the practice, but you will almost certainly need a strong refresher before you can get started.
