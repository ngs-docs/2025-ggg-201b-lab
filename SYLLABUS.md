### GitHub site: [github.com/ngs-docs/2025-ggg201b-lab](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2025-ggg-201b-lab)

This site will contain all of the actual lab lessons, and I'll post
links to them each week to canvas.

## Code of Conduct

Please abide by
[my lab's Code of Conduct](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/coc.html) in
this course.

In particular, this is not an intellectual contest, and please realize
that we all have plenty of things to learn.

## Lab sessions

What: hands-on computational work

When: Friday 9-10:50am

Where: Shields 360; Zoom.

### Recordings

Lab sessions will be recorded and available for a month; the links to
lab sessions and any associated notes will be in the comments under
the announcement for that lab.

### Computational resources

We'll be using the UC Davis High Performance Compute Cluster for all
our work; all you'll need is an Internet-connected laptop.

## Homework

There will be four homeworks, submitted via GitHub Classroom.

Homeworks can be done collaboratively, but you need to hand it in
individually. You are responsible for what you hand in.

## Grading and collaborative work

I grade each homework S/U. The division of grading between labs and
the rest of the course is in the whole course syllabus.

## Instructors

C. Titus Brown (IOR) (<ctbrown@ucdavis.edu>)

## Office hours

Office hours will be by arrangement. Typically people only come when homework
is due so I'll set up specific times before each homework :). But I'm happy
to arrange 1:1 meetings as needed; drop me an e-mail.

## Lab description

In this lab, we will work with three different automated workflows,
for three common bioinformatics tasks: variant calling, genome
assembly, and RNAseq differential expression. (These will not be
cutting edge workflows and should not be directly used for your own
work, but they will be complete and functional.)

The overall learning goals for the lab are to:

1. familiarize you with the basic operational concepts involved in
   variant calling, genome assembly, and RNAseq differential
   expression.
2. introduce the use of workflow management tools as a core aspect of
   biological data analysis.
3. describe scientific issues surrounding data analysis techniques and
   processes, including statistical issues, reproducibility,
   provenance, and publication.

In terms of technology, we'll be using the snakemake workflow system,
running on the farm cluster. We'll touch briefly on git/GitHub and
conda, but those topics will not be discussed in detail.

### Lab sessions and topics

* Labs 1-4 - variant calling and snakemake workflows
* Labs 5-7 - de novo genome assembly
* Labs 8-10 - RNAseq for differential expression analysis

### Teaching style

The labs are taught in a very hands-on way, with an emphasis on
running things first, and then going back and exploring what the
commands are doing. That means that not everything is explained in
detail the first, or even the second time, you see it! For the first
few sessions, please bear with - hopefully it will all make sense by
the end, and if not, ask questions!

## Lab location

Lab will be on Fridays 9-10:50am in Shields 360. You are welcome to
attend remotely if need be, but in-person attendance is encouraged,
even if it's really cold and dark outside.

Shields 360 is the DataLab classroom.

It is not easy to find the first time! So plan to take a few extra
minutes to get there!

You can find it by going into the Shields Library, then climbing up
the two flights of stairs and going to the right (or taking an
elevator up to the 3rd floor). It is all the way in the back of the
library on the 3rd floor, in the southeast corner. You should see a
big “DataLab” sign on the wall in front of you as you walk back from
the stairs in front.
